          <strong>BROKE BLDGS</strong> is a collaboration between musician Rick
          Mitchell and visual artist Lauren Medsker. They both came of age in
          Philadelphia’s punk/screamo/indie/D.I.Y. scene, with Mitchell playing
          in countless bands, including{" "}

          Having spent thousands of hours listening to music together, Medsker
          and Mitchell decided to create their own. Their debut album{" "}
          <i>Resurrect Dead</i> — named after Philadelphia’s mysterious{" "}

          </a>{" "}
          — pulls various elements from their record collection, drawing from
          electro, post-punk and minimalism. The music both honors and
          reinterprets the couple’s influences over the years – from Dischord
          Records to ZYX Music, from the circuitry of a Moog to the propulsion
          of Brazilian hand drums.

          The album also channels the hope and anger of the moment we’re living
          through, and the estrangement that comes when the world shuts down.
          The vocals are blurry, distorted, fucked with. The synthesizers dark,
          dizzying. The percussion somewhere between a party and a gut punch.{" "}
